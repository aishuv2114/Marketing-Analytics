**Insights & Actions**  
The lander, Mr. Fuzzy page ,and the billing page have the lowest click rates.


2)The team has tested an updated billing page based on the funnel analysis. There is a new request to see whether /billing 2 is doing any better than the original /billing page and what % of sessions on those pages end up placing an order . This test is for all traffic, not just for the search visitors

```sql
SELECT Date(Min(created_at)),
       Min(website_pageview_id)
FROM   website_pageviews
WHERE  pageview_url = '/billing-2';

SELECT pageview_url,
       Count(DISTINCT wp.website_session_id) AS 'sessions',
       Count(DISTINCT order_id) AS 'orders',
       Count(DISTINCT order_id) / Count(DISTINCT wp.website_session_id) AS 'billing_to_order_rt'
FROM   website_pageviews wp
       LEFT JOIN orders o
              ON wp. website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE  ( wp.created_at >= '2012-09-10'
         AND wp.created_at < '2012-11-10' )
       AND pageview_url LIKE '%billing%'
GROUP  BY pageview_url; 
```

 **Insights & Actions**  
The new version of the billing page is doing a much better job converting customers
As a next step,the Engineering team could roll this out to all customers
