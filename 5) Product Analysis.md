```sql
SELECT Year(ws.created_at)  AS  'yr',
       Month(ws.created_at) AS  'Mnth',
       Count(DISTINCT order_id) AS 'Orders',
       Count(DISTINCT o.order_id) / Count(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id) AS  'CVR',
       Sum(price_usd) / Count(DISTINCT ws.website_session_id)  AS 'Revenue_Per_Session',
       Count(DISTINCT CASE WHEN primary_product_id = 1 THEN o.order_id END) AS product_one_orders,
       Count(DISTINCT CASE WHEN primary_product_id = 2 THEN o.order_id END)  AS product_two_orders
FROM   website_sessions ws
       LEFT JOIN orders o
              ON ws.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE  Date(ws.created_at) >= '2012-04-01'
GROUP  BY Year(ws.created_at),
          Month(ws.created_at); 
```

 **Insights & Actions**  
 - This confirms that our conversion rate and revenue per session are improving over time
 - However,further analysis needs to be done to see if the increase is due to the new product launch or just a continuation of overall business improvements
 
 3)The website manager has request to see clickthrough rates from /products since the new product launch on January 6 th 2013 , by product, and compare to the 3 months leading up to launch as a baseline.

 **Insights**  
- The percent of /products pageviews that clicked to Mr. Fuzzy has gone down since the launch of the Love Bear,but the overall clickthrough rate has gone up, so it seems to be generating additional product interest overall.

4)On September 25th, the organization has started giving customers the option to add a 2 nd product while on the /cart page . The executive team has a request 
to compare the month before vs the month after the change ,they would like to see CTR from the /cart page ,Avg Products per Order , AOV , and overall revenue per
/cart page view
 
 
 ```sql

 **Insights & Actions**  
 It looks like the CTR from the /cart page didnâ€™t go down and the products per order, AOV, and revenue per /cart session are all up slightly since the
cross sell feature was added

5)On 12th December, 2013, a third product has been launched -"Birthday Bear". There is a request to run a pre-post analysis comparing the month before and the month after , in terms of session to order conversion rate , AOV, Products per order and Revenue per session
